# Udacity-DS-nanodegree

This is the repo for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program. 

**Project 1** is for the Introduction to Data Science project: **write a data science blog post**. I used the kaggle [Seattle Airbnb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) and focused on the Airbnb price by building a price prediction model and explored the most important features for the predictor. 

The medium blog can be seen here:

The code can be seen in [this notebook](https://github.com/dongzhang84/Udacity-DS-nanodegree/blob/master/Project_1/Seattle_Airbnb.ipynb).
