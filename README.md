# Udacity-DS-nanodegree

This is the repo for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program. 

---------
**Project 1** is for the Introduction to Data Science project: **write a data science blog post**. 


**Motivation**

From the customer perspective, it is important to better understand the Airbnb price in order to get the best rates. As the first project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree, I explored the Airbnb price in Seattle using the kaggle [Seattle Airbnb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle), and addressed three business questions:

- Does Seattle Airbnb price shows seasonal or daily variation?
- What are the most important ingredients/features for the Airbnb price?
- How to understand the most important features for the price?



**Requirements**

This project used Python 3.8.2 with its update-to-date libraries, including:

    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    sklearn
    seaborn

I use pip3 install * to install all the libraries. 


**Dataset**

The data is from the kaggle [Seattle Airbnb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)


**Files in the Repository**

The code was in [this notebook](https://github.com/dongzhang84/Udacity-DS-nanodegree/blob/master/Project_1/Seattle_Airbnb.ipynb)/

The README includes the information of the project. 


**Summary**

I found that the Airbnb price shows a seasonal variation. I built a price predictor based on features from the listings table. Among many features I explored the most important features for the price prediction, and study the correlation between these features and the price, such as weekly price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, reviews per month, cleaning fee and room types. These features can be considered as the most important indictors for evaluating the Airbnb price.
