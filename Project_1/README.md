# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project

This is for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project 1: Write a Data Science Project. 

I used the kaggle [Seattle Airbnb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) and focused on the Airbnb price by building a price prediction model and explored the most important features for the predictor.
